1. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
2. Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code
3. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
Proposed Stretch Features:
1. Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display

Instructions for Running Project:
1. Requirements will be provided in requirements.txt file for easy installation using pip.
2. Code will me run and managed in a jupyter notebook
